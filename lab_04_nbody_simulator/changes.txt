01-nbody    0.046 Billion Interactions per second   Start
01-nbody-bodyForce-kernel   19.54 Billion Interactions per second   Made the bodyForces a CUDA kernel
02-nbody-position-integration-kernel    31.79 Billion Interactions per second Made the positionIntegration a CUDA kernel. This parallelised the position integration as well as reduced page faults of DtoH. There was also a async memory prefetch added before launch of kernel.
